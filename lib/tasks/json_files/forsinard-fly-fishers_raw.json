In recent years Leir has developed into a productive early and late season loch, unfortunately, the months in between have seen the water plagued with algae during which time fishing efforts have been better concentrated elsewhere. Best bank fishing is found along the south side into SE corner where wading is easy. Although large numbers of smaller fish can be caught in the NW corner where the loch narrows, the wading here, over big boulders, is as difficult as an angler will find anywhere \u2013 boat users should take extra care to avoid the number of large rocks found in this area. Average fish size has improved to 12oz with fish of 1lb not uncommon now. Leir fish are still, without question, some of the hardest fighting trout that can be encountered!</p>"

Follow the west bank of the loch until about half way down then head SW across the moor, Eaglaise Mor is a further ten minute walk. The loch is shallow with some outstanding quality fish up to 2lbs in weight; the west bank deepens quickly and is very soft and difficult to wade in places though can be productive. Despite the challenging walk in Eaglaise Beag is a delightful place to fish, remote, peaceful and amongst the spectacular scenery of the flow country.</span></p>"

      "<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Leave the A897 at Grid reference <strong>897510</strong> follow the forestry track to park at Grid reference 861470. A 4\u00d74 or vehicle with high clearance is required to negotiate the bumpy track. The first of the lochs is a short ten minute walk in an ENE direction. The Cross Lochs are a group of 5 small lochs so-called as their layout allegedly forms the shape of a Cross. Of the 5 lochs 3 are named and four are known to contain fish. Expect more blank than productive days though there is always the possibility of one for the \u2018glass case\u2019. The first loch is shallow and reedy and can be difficult to fish, though records indicate fish to 1.5lbs being caught. Travelling SE, Mac is the next loch, not a particularly inspiring loch, shallow and peaty in places, but a reputation of producing magnificent trout up to 6.5lbs! Continuing in a SE direction is Willy\u2019s, probably the most productive loch with fish regularly caught up to 2lbs in weight with the occasional bigger fish. Willy\u2019s is easy to wade and fish are caught all over the loch. The final loch is jubilee, quite a large loch, deep in parts and very fertile.\u00a0 Surprisingly fish in the 12/14oz range can be caught in Jubilee but it is home to some seriously big trout. The majority of the loch is difficult to wade due to a soft bottom though the east bank is safe. The boat, located where the loch narrows on the northerly shore of Willy\u2019s, is available to use on Jubilee also. It will require 2 fit anglers to pull the boat the 20m distance between the lochs and anglers must return the boat to Willy\u2019s after use. For at least one angler aboard, waders are recommended when using a boat on any of the lochs, this is especially true on Willy\u2019s where the boat will have to be pulled through shallow water at times. Please note that Jubilee is out of bounds due to nesting birds for a large part of the season (May-July).</span></p>"
