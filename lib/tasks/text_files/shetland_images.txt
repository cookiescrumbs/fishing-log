Roer Water

These are three fairly large lochs which are interconnected by short burns and contain trout of 8 to 10 ounce average. The trout in Roer Water are silvery while those in the other two are a bit darker. Access from the top of Collafirth Hill or the track which joins the Collafirth road near the bottom of the hill. This track is fairly rough and there is a burn to cross so vehicle access is difficult. There are many other lochs, both large and small, in the area but be aware that it is easy to get lost here if the fog rolls in and a map and compass or GPS should be carried.
